If value is omitted or is 0, -0, null, false, NaN, undefined, or the empty string (\"\"), the object has an initial value of false. All other values, including any object or the string \"false\", create an object with an initial value of true.\n\nDo not confuse the primitive Boolean values true and false with the true and false values of the Boolean object.\n\nAny object whose value is not undefined or null, including a Boolean object whose value is false, evaluates to true when passed to a conditional statement. For example, the condition in the following if statement evaluates to true:\n\n\tx = new Boolean(false);\n\tif (x) {\n\t  // . . . this code is executed\n\t}\n\tThis behavior does not apply to Boolean primitives. For example, the condition in the following if statement evaluates to false:\n\n\tx = false;\n\tif (x) {\n\t  // . . . this code is not executed\n\t}\nDo not use a Boolean object to convert a non-boolean value to a boolean value. Instead, use Boolean as a function to perform this task:\n\n\tx = Boolean(expression);     // preferred\n\tx = new Boolean(expression); // don't use\n\tIf you specify any object, including a Boolean object whose value is false, as the initial value of a Boolean object, the new Boolean object has a value of true.\n\n\tmyFalse = new Boolean(false);   // initial value of false\n\tg = new Boolean(myFalse);       // initial value of true\n\tmyString = new String(\"Hello\"); // string object\n\ts = new Boolean(myString);      // initial value of true\n\tDo not use a Boolean object in place of a Boolean primitive.\n\n#Properties\nFor properties available on Boolean instances, see Properties of Boolean instances.\n\nBoolean.length\nLength property whose value is 1.\nBoolean.prototype\nRepresents the prototype for the Boolean constructor.\n#Properties inherited from Function:\narity, caller, constructor, length, name\n##Methods\nFor methods available on Boolean instances, see Methods of Boolean instances.\n\nThe global Boolean object contains no methods of its own, however, it does inherit some methods through the prototype chain:\n\n#Methods inherited from Function:\napply, call, toSource, toString\n\n#Boolean instances\nAll Boolean instances inherit from Boolean.prototype.

For a list of properties and methods inherited by Error instances, see Error.prototype.\n\n#Error types\n\nBesides the generic Error constructor, there are six other core error constructors in JavaScript.

You can handle the error using the try...catch construct:\n\n\ttry {\n\t  throw new Error(\"Whoops!\");\n\t} catch (e) {\n\t  alert(e.name + \": \" + e.message);\n\t}\n\tExample: Handling a specific error\n\n\tYou can choose to handle only specific error types by testing the error type with the error's constructor property or, if you're writing for modern JavaScript engines, instanceof keyword:\n\n\ttry {\n\t  foo.bar();\n\t} catch (e) {\n\t  if (e instanceof EvalError) {\n\t    alert(e.name + \": \" + e.message);\n\t  } else if (e instanceof RangeError) {\n\t    alert(e.name + \": \" + e.message);\n\t  }\n\t  // ... etc\n\t}\n##Custom Error Types\n\nYou might want to define your own error types deriving from Error to be able to throw new MyError() and use instanceof MyError to check the kind of error in the exception handler. The common way to do this is demonstrated below.\n\nNote that the thrown MyError will report incorrect lineNumber and fileName at least in Firefox.\nSee also the \"What's a good way to extend Error in JavaScript?\" discussion on Stackoverflow.\n\n\t// Create a new object, that prototypally inherits from the Error constructor.\n\tfunction MyError(message) {\n\t  this.name = \"MyError\";\n\t  this.message = message || \"Default Message\";\n\t}\n\tMyError.prototype = new Error();\n\tMyError.prototype.constructor = MyError;\n\n\ttry {\n\t  throw new MyError();\n\t} catch (e) {\n\t  console.log(e.name);     // \"MyError\"\n\t  console.log(e.message);  // \"Default Message\"\n\t}\n\n\ttry {\n\t  throw new MyError(\"custom message\");\n\t} catch (e) {\n\t  console.log(e.name);     // \"MyError\"\n\t  console.log(e.message);  // \"custom message\"\n\t}\n\n*/\n\n/*\n\n@constructor Boolean\n@param {String} message Human-readable description of the error\n@param {String} fileName The value for the fileName property on the created Error object.

Function.prototype cannot be modified.\n*/\n\n\n\n/*\n@method apply\n\nThe apply() method calls a function with a given this value and arguments provided as an array (or an array-like object).\n\nNote: While the syntax of this function is almost identical to that of call(), the fundamental difference is that call() accepts an argument list, while apply() accepts a single array of arguments.\n#Syntax\n\tfun.apply(thisArg, [argsArray])\n#Description\nYou can assign a different this object when calling an existing function. this refers to the current object, the calling object. With apply, you can write a method once and then inherit it in another object, without having to rewrite the method for the new object.\n\napply is very similar to call(), except for the type of arguments it supports. You can use an arguments array instead of a named set of parameters. With apply, you can use an array literal, for example, fun.apply(this, ['eat', 'bananas']), or an Array object, for example, fun.apply(this, new Array('eat', 'bananas')).\n\nYou can also use arguments for the argsArray parameter. arguments is a local variable of a function. It can be used for all unspecified arguments of the called object. Thus, you do not have to know the arguments of the called object when you use the apply method. You can use arguments to pass all the arguments to the called object. The called object is then responsible for handling the arguments.\n\nSince ECMAScript 5th Edition you can also use any kind of object which is array-like, so in practice this means it's going to have a property length and integer properties in the range [0...length). As an example you can now use a NodeList or a own custom object like {'length': 2, '0': 'eat', '1': 'bananas'}.\n\nNote: Most browsers, including Chrome 14 and Internet Explorer 9, still do not accept array-like objects and will throw an exception.\n#Examples\nUsing apply to chain constructors\n\nYou can use apply to chain constructors for an object, similar to Java. In the following example we will create a global Function method called construct, which will make you able to use an array-like object with a constructor instead of an arguments list.\n\n\tFunction.prototype.construct = function (aArgs) {\n\t    var fConstructor = this, fNewConstr = function () { fConstructor.apply(this, aArgs); };\n\t    fNewConstr.prototype = fConstructor.prototype;\n\t    return new fNewConstr();\n\t};\n\nExample usage:\n\n\tfunction MyConstructor () {\n\t    for (var nProp = 0; nProp < arguments.length; nProp++) {\n\t        this[\"property\" + nProp] = arguments[nProp];\n\t    }\n\t}\n\n\tvar myArray = [4, \"Hello world!\", false];\n\tvar myInstance = MyConstructor.construct(myArray);\n\n\talert(myInstance.property1); // alerts \"Hello world!\"\n\talert(myInstance instanceof MyConstructor); // alerts \"true\"\n\talert(myInstance.constructor); // alerts \"MyConstructor\"\n\nNote: This non-native Function.construct method will not work with some native constructors (like Date, for example). In these cases you have to use the Function.bind method (for example, imagine to have an array like the following, to be used with Date constructor: [2012, 11, 4]; in this case you have to write something like: new (Function.prototype.bind.apply(Date, [null].concat([2012, 11, 4])))() – anyhow this is not the best way to do things and probably should not be used in any production environment).\nUsing apply and built-in functions\n\nClever usage of apply allows you to use built-ins functions for some tasks that otherwise probably would have been written by looping over the array values. As an example here we are going to use Math.max/Math.min to find out the maximum/minimum value in an array.\n\n\t//min/max number in an array \n\tvar numbers = [5, 6, 2, 3, 7];\n\n\t//using Math.min/Math.max apply \n\tvar max = Math.max.apply(null, numbers); // This about equal to Math.max(numbers[0], ...) or Math.max(5, 6, ..) \n\tvar min = Math.min.apply(null, numbers);\n\n\t/ vs. simple loop based algorithm \n\tmax = -Infinity, min = +Infinity;\n\n\tfor (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {\n\t  if (numbers[i] > max)\n\t    max = numbers[i];\n\t  if (numbers[i] < min) \n\t    min = numbers[i];\n\t}\n\nBut beware: in using apply this way, you run the risk of exceeding the JavaScript engine's argument length limit. The consequences of applying a function with too many arguments (think more than tens of thousands of arguments) vary across engines (JavaScriptCore has hard-coded argument limit of 65536), because the limit (indeed even the nature of any excessively-large-stack behavior) is unspecified. Some engines will throw an exception. More perniciously, others will arbitrarily limit the number of arguments actually passed to the applied function. (To illustrate this latter case: if such an engine had a limit of four arguments [actual limits are of course significantly higher], it would be as if the arguments 5, 6, 2, 3 had been passed to apply in the examples above, rather than the full array.) If your value array might grow into the tens of thousands, use a hybrid strategy: apply your function to chunks of the array at a time:\n\n\tfunction minOfArray(arr) {\n\t  var min = Infinity;\n\t  var QUANTUM = 32768;\n\n\t  for (var i = 0, len = arr.length; i < len; i += QUANTUM) {\n\t    var submin = Math.min.apply(null, arr.slice(i, Math.min(i + QUANTUM, len)));\n\t    min = Math.min(submin, min);\n\t  }\n\n\t  return min;\n\t}\n\n\tvar min = minOfArray([5, 6, 2, 3, 7]);\nUsing apply in \"monkey-patching\"\n\nApply can be the best way to monkey-patch a builtin function of Firefox, or JS libraries. Given someobject.foo function, you can modify the function in a somewhat hacky way, like so:\n\n\tvar originalfoo = someobject.foo;\n\tsomeobject.foo = function() {\n\t  //Do stuff before calling function\n\t  console.log(arguments);\n\t  //Call the function as it would have been called normally:\n\t  originalfoo.apply(this,arguments);\n\t  //Run stuff after, here.\n\t}\n\nThis method is especially handy where you want to debug events, or interface with something that has no API like the various .on([event]... events, such as those usable on the Devtools Inspector).\n\n\n@param {Object}thisArg The value of this provided for the call to fun. Note that this may not be the actual value seen by the method: if the method is a function in non-strict mode code, null and undefined will be replaced with the global object, and primitive values will be boxed.\n@param {Array} argsArray An array-like object, specifying the arguments with which fun should be called, or null or undefined if no arguments should be provided to the function. Starting with ECMAScript 5 these arguments can be a generic array-like object instead of an array. See below for browser compatibility information.\n\n@returns the result of evaluating this function with given context and parameters\n*/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/*\n@method bind\n\n#Summary\nThe bind() method creates a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.\n\n#Syntax\n\tfun.bind(thisArg[, arg1[, arg2[, ...]]])\n\n#Description\nThe bind() function creates a new function (a bound function) with the same function body (internal call property in ECMAScript 5 terms) as the function it is being called on (the bound function's target function) with the this value bound to the first argument of bind(), which cannot be overridden. bind() also accepts leading default arguments to provide to the target function when the bound function is called. A bound function may also be constructed using the new operator: doing so acts as though the target function had instead been constructed. The provided this value is ignored, while prepended arguments are provided to the emulated function.\n\n#Examples\nCreating a bound function\n\nThe simplest use of bind() is to make a function that, no matter how it is called, is called with a particular this value. A common mistake for new JavaScript programmers is to extract a method from an object, then to later call that function and expect it to use the original object as its this (e.g. by using that method in callback-based code). Without special care, however, the original object is usually lost. Creating a bound function from the function, using the original object, neatly solves this problem:\n\n\tthis.x = 9; \n\tvar module = {\n\t  x: 81,\n\t  getX: function() { return this.x; }\n\t};\n\n\tmodule.getX(); // 81\n\n\tvar getX = module.getX;\n\tgetX(); // 9, because in this case, \"this\" refers to the global object\n\n\t// create a new function with 'this' bound to module\n\tvar boundGetX = getX.bind(module);\n\tboundGetX(); // 81\n\n##Partial Functions\n\nThe next simplest use of bind() is to make a function with pre-specified initial arguments. These arguments (if any) follow the provided this value and are then inserted at the start of the arguments passed to the target function, followed by the arguments passed to the bound function, whenever the bound function is called.\n\n\tfunction list() {\n\t  return Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);\n\t}\n\n\tvar list1 = list(1, 2, 3); // [1, 2, 3]\n\n\t//  Create a function with a preset leading argument\n\tvar leadingThirtysevenList = list.bind(undefined, 37);\n\n\tvar list2 = leadingThirtysevenList(); // [37]\n\tvar list3 = leadingThirtysevenList(1, 2, 3); // [37, 1, 2, 3]\n\n##With setTimeout\n\nBy default within window.setTimeout(), the this keyword will be set to the window (or global) object. When working with class methods that require this to refer to class instances, you may explicitly bind this to the callback function, in order to maintain the instance.\n\n\tfunction LateBloomer() {\n\t  this.petalCount = Math.ceil( Math.random() * 12 ) + 1;\n\t}\n\n\t// declare bloom after a delay of 1 second\n\tLateBloomer.prototype.bloom = function() {\n\t  window.setTimeout( this.declare.bind( this ), 1000 );\n\t};\n\n\tLateBloomer.prototype.declare = function() {\n\t  console.log('I am a beautiful flower with ' + \n\t    this.petalCount + ' petals!');\n\t};\n\n##Bound functions used as constructors\n\nWarning: This section demonstrates JavaScript capabilities and documents some edge cases of the bind() method. The methods shown below are not the best way to do things and probably should not be used in any production environment.\nBound functions are automatically suitable for use with the new operator to construct new instances created by the target function. When a bound function is used to construct a value, the provided this is ignored. However, provided arguments are still prepended to the constructor call:\n\n\tfunction Point(x, y) {\n\t  this.x = x;\n\t  this.y = y;\n\t}\n\n\tPoint.prototype.toString = function() { \n\t  return this.x + \",\" + this.y; \n\t};\n\n\tvar p = new Point(1, 2);\n\tp.toString(); // \"1,2\"\n\n\n\tvar emptyObj = {};\n\tvar YAxisPoint = Point.bind(emptyObj, 0);\n\t// not supported in the polyfill below, works fine with native bind:\n\tvar YAxisPoint = Point.bind(null,0 );\n\n\tvar axisPoint = new YAxisPoint(5);\n\taxisPoint.toString(); //  \"0,5\"\n\n\taxisPoint instanceof Point; // true\n\taxisPoint instanceof YAxisPoint; // true\n\tnew Point(17, 42) instanceof YAxisPoint; // false\nNote that you need do nothing special to create a bound function for use with new. The corollary is that you need do nothing special to create a bound function to be called plainly, even if you would rather require the bound function to only be called using new.\n\n\t// Example can be run directly in your JavaScript console\n\t// ...continuing from above\n\n\t// Can still be called as a normal function \n\t// (although usually this is undesired)\n\tYAxisPoint(13);\n\n\temptyObj.x + \",\" + emptyObj.y;\n\t// >  \"0,13\"\nIf you wish to support use of a bound function only using new, or only by calling it, the target function must enforce that restriction.\n\n##Creating shortcuts\n\nbind() is also helpful in cases where you want to create a shortcut to a function which requires a specific this value.\n\nTake Array.prototype.slice, for example, which you want to use for converting an array-like object to a real array. You could create a shortcut like this:\n\n\tvar slice = Array.prototype.slice;\n\n\t// ...\n\n\tslice.call(arguments);\n\tWith bind(), this can be simplified. In the following piece of code, slice is a bound function to the call() function of Function.prototype, with the this value set to the slice() function of Array.prototype. This means that additional call() calls can be eliminated:\n\n\t// same as \"slice\" in the previous example\n\tvar unboundSlice = Array.prototype.slice;\n\tvar slice = Function.prototype.call.bind(unboundSlice);\n\n\t// ...\n\n\tslice(arguments);\n#Polyfill\nThe bind function is a recent addition to ECMA-262, 5th edition; as such it may not be present in all browsers. You can partially work around this by inserting the following code at the beginning of your scripts, allowing use of much of the functionality of bind() in implementations that do not natively support it.\n\n\tif (!Function.prototype.bind) {\n\t  Function.prototype.bind = function (oThis) {\n\t    if (typeof this !== \"function\") {\n\t      // closest thing possible to the ECMAScript 5\n\t      // internal IsCallable function\n\t      throw new TypeError(\"Function.prototype.bind - what is trying to be bound is not callable\");\n\t    }\n\n\t    var aArgs = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1), \n\t        fToBind = this, \n\t        fNOP = function () {},\n\t        fBound = function () {\n\t          return fToBind.apply(this instanceof fNOP && oThis\n\t                 ? this\n\t                 : oThis,\n\t                 aArgs.concat(Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)));\n\t        };\n\n\t    fNOP.prototype = this.prototype;\n\t    fBound.prototype = new fNOP();\n\n\t    return fBound;\n\t  };\n\t}\n\nSome of the many differences (there may well be others, as this list does not seriously attempt to be exhaustive) between this algorithm and the specified algorithm are:\n\nThe partial implementation relies Array.prototype.slice, Array.prototype.concat, Function.prototype.call and Function.prototype.apply, built-in methods to have their original values.\nThe partial implementation creates functions that do not have immutable \"poison pill\" caller and arguments properties that throw a TypeError upon get, set, or deletion. (This could be added if the implementation supports Object.defineProperty, or partially implemented [without throw-on-delete behavior] if the implementation supports the __defineGetter__ and __defineSetter__ extensions.)\nThe partial implementation creates functions that have a prototype property. (Proper bound functions have none.)\nThe partial implementation creates bound functions whose length property does not agree with that mandated by ECMA-262: it creates functions with length 0, while a full implementation, depending on the length of the target function and the number of pre-specified arguments, may return a non-zero length.\nIf you choose to use this partial implementation, you must not rely on those cases where behavior deviates from ECMA-262, 5th edition! With some care, however (and perhaps with additional modification to suit specific needs), this partial implementation may be a reasonable bridge to the time when bind() is widely implemented according to the specification.\n\n@param thisArg The value to be passed as the this parameter to the target function when the bound function is called.

In the following example, the constructor for the Product object is defined with two parameters, name and price. Two other functions Food and Toy invoke Product passing this and name and price. Product initializes the properties name and price, both specialized functions define the category.\n\n\tfunction Product(name, price) {\n\t  this.name = name;\n\t  this.price = price;\n\n\t  if (price < 0) {\n\t    throw RangeError('Cannot create product ' +\n\t                      this.name + ' with a negative price');\n\t  }\n\n\t  return this;\n\t}\n\n\tfunction Food(name, price) {\n\t  Product.call(this, name, price);\n\t  this.category = 'food';\n\t}\n\n\tFood.prototype = Object.create(Product.prototype);\n\n\tfunction Toy(name, price) {\n\t  Product.call(this, name, price);\n\t  this.category = 'toy';\n\t}\n\n\tToy.prototype = Object.create(Product.prototype);\n\n\tvar cheese = new Food('feta', 5);\n\tvar fun = new Toy('robot', 40);\n \n##Using call to invoke an anonymous function\n\nIn this purely constructed example, we create anonymous function and use call to invoke it on every object in an array. The main purpose of the anonymous function here is to add a print function to every object, which is able to print the right index of the object in the array. Passing the object as this value was not strictly necessary, but is done for explanatory purpose.\n\n\tvar animals = [\n\t  {species: 'Lion', name: 'King'},\n\t  {species: 'Whale', name: 'Fail'}\n\t];\n\n\tfor (var i = 0; i < animals.length; i++) {\n\t  (function (i) { \n\t    this.print = function () { \n\t      console.log('#' + i  + ' ' + this.species \n\t                  + ': ' + this.name); \n\t    } \n\t    this.print();\n\t  }).call(animals[i], i);\n\t}\n\n\n@param thisArg The value of this provided for the call to fun. Note that this may not be the actual value seen by the method: if the method is a function in non-strict mode code, null and undefined will be replaced with the global object, and primitive values will be boxed.\n@param arg1,arg2,...

By default, the toString() method is inherited by every object descended from Object. If this method is not overridden in a custom object, toString() returns \"[object type]\", where type is the object type. The following code illustrates this:\n\nvar o = new Object();\no.toString();           // returns [object Object]\nStarting in JavaScript 1.8.5 toString() called on null returns [object Null], and undefined returns [object Undefined], as defined in the 5th Edition of ECMAScript and a subsequent Errata. See Using toString to detect object type.\n##Examples\n###Overriding the default toString method\n\nYou can create a function to be called in place of the default toString() method. The toString() method takes no arguments and should return a string. The toString() method you create can be any value you want, but it will be most useful if it carries information about the object.\n\nThe following code defines the Dog object type and creates theDog, an object of type Dog:\n\n\tfunction Dog(name,breed,color,sex) {\n\t   this.name=name;\n\t   this.breed=breed;\n\t   this.color=color;\n\t   this.sex=sex;\n\t}\n\n\ttheDog = new Dog(\"Gabby\",\"Lab\",\"chocolate\",\"female\");\nIf you call the toString() method on this custom object, it returns the default value inherited from Object:\n\n\ttheDog.toString(); //returns [object Object]\n\tThe following code creates and assigns dogToString() to override the default toString() method. This function generates a string containing the name, breed, color, and sex of the object, in the form \"property = value;\".\n\n\tDog.prototype.toString = function dogToString() {\n\t  var ret = \"Dog \" + this.name + \" is a \" + this.sex + \" \" + this.color + \" \" + this.breed;\n\t  return ret;\n\t}\nWith the preceding code in place, any time theDog is used in a string context, JavaScript automatically calls the dogToString() function, which returns the following string:\n\nDog Gabby is a female chocolate Lab\nUsing toString() to detect object class\n\ntoString() can be used with every object and allows you to get its class.

Normal property addition through assignment creates properties which show up during property enumeration (for...in loop or Object.keys method), whose values may be changed, and which may be deleted. This method allows these extra details to be changed from their defaults.\n\nProperty descriptors present in objects come in two main flavors: data descriptors and accessor descriptors. A data descriptor is a property that has a value, which may or may not be writable. An accessor descriptor is a property described by a getter-setter pair of functions. A descriptor must be one of these two flavors; it cannot be both.\n\nBoth data and accessor descriptors are objects. They share the following optional keys:\n\n###configurable\ntrue if and only if the type of this property descriptor may be changed and if the property may be deleted from the corresponding object.\nDefaults to false.\n\n###enumerable\ntrue if and only if this property shows up during enumeration of the properties on the corresponding object.\nDefaults to false.\nA data descriptor also has the following optional keys:\n\n###value\nThe value associated with the property. Can be any valid JavaScript value (number, object, function, etc).\nDefaults to undefined.\nwritable\ntrue if and only if the value associated with the property may be changed with an assignment operator.\nDefaults to false.\nAn accessor descriptor also has the following optional keys:\n\n###get\nA function which serves as a getter for the property, or undefined if there is no getter. The function return will be used as the value of property.\nDefaults to undefined.\n\n###set\nA function which serves as a setter for the property, or undefined if there is no setter. The function will receive as only argument the new value being assigned to the property.\nDefaults to undefined.\nBear in mind that these options are not necessarily own properties so, if inherited, will be considered too. In order to ensure these defaults are preserved you might freeze the Object.prototype upfront, specify all options explicitly, or point to null as __proto__ property.\n\n\t// using __proto__\n\tObject.defineProperty(obj, 'key', {\n\t  __proto__: null, // no inherited properties\n\t  value: 'static'  // not enumerable\n\t                   // not configurable\n\t                   // not writable\n\t                   // as defaults\n\t});\n\n\t// being explicit\n\tObject.defineProperty(obj, 'key', {\n\t  enumerable: false,\n\t  configurable: false,\n\t  writable: false,\n\t  value: 'static'\n\t});\n\n\t// recycling same object\n\tfunction withValue(value) {\n\t  var d = withValue.d || (\n\t    withValue.d = {\n\t      enumerable: false,\n\t      writable: false,\n\t      configurable: false,\n\t      value: null\n\t    }\n\t  );\n\t  d.value = value;\n\t  return d;\n\t}\n\t// ... and ...\n\tObject.defineProperty(obj, 'key', withValue('static'));\n\n\t// if freeze is available, prevents the code to add\n\t// value, get, set, enumerable, writable, configurable\n\t// to the Object prototype\n\t(Object.freeze || Object)(Object.prototype);\n\n#Examples\n\nIf you want to see how to use the Object.defineProperty method with a binary-flags-like syntax, see additional examples.\n\n##Example: Creating a property\n\nWhen the property specified doesn't exist in the object, Object.defineProperty() creates a new property as described. Fields may be omitted from the descriptor, and default values for those fields are imputed. All of the Boolean-valued fields default to false. The value, get, and set fields default to undefined. A property which is defined without get/set/value/writable is called “generic” and is “typed” as a data descriptor.\n\n\tvar o = {}; // Creates a new object\n\n\t// Example of an object property added with defineProperty with a data property descriptor\n\tObject.defineProperty(o, 'a', {\n\t  value: 37,\n\t  writable: true,\n\t  enumerable: true,\n\t  configurable: true\n\t});\n\t// 'a' property exists in the o object and its value is 37\n\n\t// Example of an object property added with defineProperty with an accessor property descriptor\n\tvar bValue = 38;\n\tObject.defineProperty(o, 'b', {\n\t  get: function() { return bValue; },\n\t  set: function(newValue) { bValue = newValue; },\n\t  enumerable: true,\n\t  configurable: true\n\t});\n\to.b; // 38\n\t// 'b' property exists in the o object and its value is 38\n\t// The value of o.b is now always identical to bValue, unless o.b is redefined\n\n\t// You cannot try to mix both:\n\tObject.defineProperty(o, 'conflict', {\n\t  value: 0x9f91102,\n\t  get: function() { return 0xdeadbeef; }\n\t});\n\t// throws a TypeError: value appears only in data descriptors, get appears only in accessor descriptors\n\n##Example: Modifying a property\n\nWhen the property already exists, Object.defineProperty() attempts to modify the property according to the values in the descriptor and the object's current configuration. If the old descriptor had its configurable attribute set to false (the property is said to be “non-configurable”), then no attribute besides writable can be changed. In that case, it is also not possible to switch back and forth between the data and accessor property types.\n\nIf a property is non-configurable, its writable attribute can only be changed to false.\n\nA TypeError is thrown when attempts are made to change non-configurable property attributes (besides the writable attribute) unless the current and new values are the same.\n\n##Writable attribute\n\nWhen the writable property attribute is set to false, the property is said to be “non-writable”. It cannot be reassigned.\n\n\tvar o = {}; // Creates a new object\n\n\tObject.defineProperty(o, 'a', {\n\t  value: 37,\n\t  writable: false\n\t});\n\n\tconsole.log(o.a); // logs 37\n\to.a = 25; // No error thrown (it would throw in strict mode, even if the value had been the same)\n\tconsole.log(o.a); // logs 37. The assignment didn't work.\n\nAs seen in the example, trying to write into the non-writable property doesn't change it but doesn't throw an error either.\n\n##Enumerable attribute\n\nThe enumerable property attribute defines whether the property shows up in a for...in loop and Object.keys() or not.\n\n\tvar o = {};\n\tObject.defineProperty(o, 'a', { value: 1, enumerable: true });\n\tObject.defineProperty(o, 'b', { value: 2, enumerable: false });\n\tObject.defineProperty(o, 'c', { value: 3 }); // enumerable defaults to false\n\to.d = 4; // enumerable defaults to true when creating a property by setting it\n\n\tfor (var i in o) {\n\t  console.log(i);\n\t}\n\t// logs 'a' and 'd' (in undefined order)\n\n\tObject.keys(o); // ['a', 'd']\n\n\to.propertyIsEnumerable('a'); // true\n\to.propertyIsEnumerable('b'); // false\n\to.propertyIsEnumerable('c'); // false\n\tConfigurable attribute\n\n\tThe configurable attribute controls at the same time whether the property can be deleted from the object and whether its attributes (other than writable) can be changed.\n\n\tvar o = {};\n\tObject.defineProperty(o, 'a', {\n\t  get: function() { return 1; },\n\t  configurable: false\n\t});\n\n\tObject.defineProperty(o, 'a', { configurable: true }); // throws a TypeError\n\tObject.defineProperty(o, 'a', { enumerable: true }); // throws a TypeError\n\tObject.defineProperty(o, 'a', { set: function() {} }); // throws a TypeError (set was undefined previously)\n\tObject.defineProperty(o, 'a', { get: function() { return 1; } }); // throws a TypeError (even though the new get does exactly the same thing)\n\tObject.defineProperty(o, 'a', { value: 12 }); // throws a TypeError\n\n\tconsole.log(o.a); // logs 1\n\tdelete o.a; // Nothing happens\n\tconsole.log(o.a); // logs 1\n\n\nIf the configurable attribute of o.a had been true, none of the errors would be thrown and the property would be deleted at the end.\n\n##Example: Adding properties and default values\n\nIt's important to consider the way default values of attributes are applied. There is often a difference between simply using dot notation to assign a value and using Object.defineProperty(), as shown in the example below.\n\n\tvar o = {};\n\n\to.a = 1;\n\t// is equivalent to:\n\tObject.defineProperty(o, 'a', {\n\t  value: 1,\n\t  writable: true,\n\t  configurable: true,\n\t  enumerable: true\n\t});\n\n\n\t// On the other hand,\n\tObject.defineProperty(o, 'a', { value: 1 });\n\t// is equivalent to:\n\tObject.defineProperty(o, 'a', {\n\t  value: 1,\n\t  writable: false,\n\t  configurable: false,\n\t  enumerable: false\n\t});\n\n\n##Example: Custom Setters and Getters\n\nExample below shows how to implement a self-archiving object. When temperature property is set, the archive array gets a log entry.\n\n\tfunction Archiver() {\n\t  var temperature = null;\n\t  var archive = [];\n\n\t  Object.defineProperty(this, 'temperature', {\n\t    get: function() {\n\t      console.log('get!');\n\t      return temperature;\n\t    },\n\t    set: function(value) {\n\t      temperature = value;\n\t      archive.push({ val: temperature });\n\t    }\n\t  });\n\n\t  this.getArchive = function() { return archive; };\n\t}\n\n\tvar arc = new Archiver();\n\tarc.temperature; // 'get!'\n\tarc.temperature = 11;\n\tarc.temperature = 13;\n\tarc.getArchive(); // [{ val: 11 }, { val: 13 }]\t\n\n\n@static\n@param {Object} obj The object on which to define the property.\n@param {String} prop The name of the property to be defined or modified.\n@param {Object} descriptor The descriptor for the property being defined or modified.\n\n*/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/*\n@method freeze\n\n#Summary\nThe Object.freeze() method freezes an object: that is, prevents new properties from being added to it; prevents existing properties from being removed; and prevents existing properties, or their enumerability, configurability, or writability, from being changed. In essence the object is made effectively immutable. The method returns the object being frozen.\n\n#Syntax\nObject.freeze(obj)\n\n#Description\nNothing can be added to or removed from the properties set of a frozen object.

By default, the toString() method is inherited by every object descended from Object. If this method is not overridden in a custom object, toString() returns \"[object type]\", where type is the object type. The following code illustrates this:\n\n\tvar o = new Object();\n\to.toString();           // returns [object Object]\nNote: Starting in JavaScript 1.8.5 toString() called on null returns [object Null], and undefined returns [object Undefined], as defined in the 5th Edition of ECMAScript and a subsequent Errata. See Using toString to detect object type.\n#Examples\n##Example: Overriding the default toString method\n\nYou can create a function to be called in place of the default toString() method. The toString() method takes no arguments and should return a string. The toString() method you create can be any value you want, but it will be most useful if it carries information about the object.\n\nThe following code defines the Dog object type and creates theDog, an object of type Dog:\n\n\tfunction Dog(name, breed, color, sex) {\n\t  this.name = name;\n\t  this.breed = breed;\n\t  this.color = color;\n\t  this.sex = sex;\n\t}\n\n\ttheDog = new Dog('Gabby', 'Lab', 'chocolate', 'female');\nIf you call the toString() method on this custom object, it returns the default value inherited from Object:\n\n\ttheDog.toString(); // returns [object Object]\nThe following code creates and assigns dogToString() to override the default toString() method.

You rarely need to invoke the valueOf method yourself; JavaScript automatically invokes it when encountering an object where a primitive value is expected.\n\nBy default, the valueOf method is inherited by every object descended from Object. Every built-in core object overrides this method to return an appropriate value. If an object has no primitive value, valueOf returns the object itself, which is displayed as:\n\n\t[object Object]\nYou can use valueOf within your own code to convert a built-in object into a primitive value. When you create a custom object, you can override Object.prototype.valueOf() to call a custom method instead of the default Object method.\n\n##Overriding valueOf for custom objects\n\nYou can create a function to be called in place of the default valueOf method. Your function must take no arguments.\n\nSuppose you have an object type myNumberType and you want to create a valueOf method for it. The following code assigns a user-defined function to the object's valueOf method:\n\n\tmyNumberType.prototype.valueOf = function() { return customPrimitiveValue; };\nWith the preceding code in place, any time an object of type myNumberType is used in a context where it is to be represented as a primitive value, JavaScript automatically calls the function defined in the preceding code.\n\nAn object's valueOf method is usually invoked by JavaScript, but you can invoke it yourself as follows:\n\n\tmyNumber.valueOf()\nNote: Objects in string contexts convert via the toString() method, which is different from String objects converting to string primitives using valueOf. All objects have a string conversion, if only \"[object type]\". But many objects do not convert to number, boolean, or function.\n#Examples\n##Example: Using valueOf\n\n\to = new Object();\n\tmyVar = o.valueOf();      // [object Object]\n*/\n\n\n\n\n/*\n@method seal\n#Summary\nThe Object.seal() method seals an object, preventing new properties from being added to it and marking all existing properties as non-configurable. Values of present properties can still be changed as long as they are writable.\n\n#Syntax\n\tObject.seal(obj)\n\n#Description\nBy default, objects are extensible (new properties can be added to them). Sealing an object prevents new properties from being added and marks all existing properties as non-configurable. This has the effect of making the set of properties on the object fixed and immutable. Making all properties non-configurable also prevents them from being converted from data properties to accessor properties and vice versa, but it does not prevent the values of data properties from being changed. Attempting to delete or add properties to a sealed object, or to convert a data property to accessor or vice versa, will fail, either silently or by throwing a TypeError (most commonly, although not exclusively, when in strict mode code).\n\nThe prototype chain remains untouched. However, the __proto__  property is sealed as well.\n\n#Examples\n\tvar obj = {\n\t  prop: function() {},\n\t  foo: 'bar'\n\t};\n\n\t// New properties may be added, existing properties may be changed or removed.\n\tobj.foo = 'baz';\n\tobj.lumpy = 'woof';\n\tdelete obj.prop;\n\n\tvar o = Object.seal(obj);\n\n\tassert(o === obj);\n\tassert(Object.isSealed(obj) === true);\n\n\t// Changing property values on a sealed object still works.\n\tobj.foo = 'quux';\n\n\t// But you can't convert data properties to accessors, or vice versa.\n\tObject.defineProperty(obj, 'foo', { get: function() { return 'g'; } }); // throws a TypeError\n\n\t// Now any changes, other than to property values, will fail.\n\tobj.quaxxor = 'the friendly duck'; // silently doesn't add the property\n\tdelete obj.foo; // silently doesn't delete the property\n\n\t// ...and in strict mode such attempts will throw TypeErrors.\n\tfunction fail() {\n\t  'use strict';\n\t  delete obj.foo; // throws a TypeError\n\t  obj.sparky = 'arf'; // throws a TypeError\n\t}\n\tfail();\n\n\t// Attempted additions through Object.defineProperty will also throw.\n\tObject.defineProperty(obj, 'ohai', { value: 17 }); // throws a TypeError\n\tObject.defineProperty(obj, 'foo', { value: 'eit' }); // changes existing property value\n\n@static \n\n@param  obj The object which should be sealed.\n*/\n\n\n\n\n\n/*\n@class Any\nThis is an artificial type that means 'any value is valid here'\n*/\n\n/*\n\n@module javascript \n\n\n\n@class ObjectPrototype\n\nAdapted from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/prototype\n\n#Description\nThe Object.prototype property represents the Object prototype object.\n\nAll objects in JavaScript are descended from Object; all objects inherit methods and properties from Object.prototype, although they may be overridden (except an Object with a null prototype, i.e. Object.create(null)). For example, other constructors' prototypes override the constructor property and provide their own toString() methods. Changes to the Object prototype object are propagated to all objects unless the properties and methods subject to those changes are overridden further along the prototype chain.\n\n#Examples\nSince Javascript doesn't exactly have sub-class objects, prototype is a useful workaround to make a “base class” object of certain functions that act as objects. For example:\n\n\tvar Person = function() {\n\t  this.canTalk = true;\n\t  this.greet = function() {\n\t    if (this.canTalk) {\n\t      console.log('Hi, I'm ' + this.name);\n\t    }\n\t  };\n\t};\n\n\tvar Employee = function(name, title) {\n\t  this.name = name;\n\t  this.title = title;\n\t  this.greet = function() {\n\t    if (this.canTalk) {\n\t      console.log(\"Hi, I'm \" + this.name + \", the \" + this.title);\n\t    }\n\t  };\n\t};\n\tEmployee.prototype = new Person();\n\n\tvar Customer = function(name) {\n\t  this.name = name;\n\t};\n\tCustomer.prototype = new Person();\n\n\tvar Mime = function(name) {\n\t  this.name = name;\n\t  this.canTalk = false;\n\t};\n\tMime.prototype = new Person();\n\n\tvar bob = new Employee('Bob', 'Builder');\n\tvar joe = new Customer('Joe');\n\tvar rg = new Employee('Red Green', 'Handyman');\n\tvar mike = new Customer('Mike');\n\tvar mime = new Mime('Mime');\n\tbob.greet();\n\tjoe.greet();\n\trg.greet();\n\tmike.greet();\n\tmime.greet();\n\nThis will output:\n\n\tHi, I'm Bob, the Builder\n\tHi, I'm Joe\n\tHi, I'm Red Green, the Handyman\n\tHi, I'm Mike\n\n*/\n\n\n\n/*\n\n\n\n@property {Function} constructor Specifies the function that creates an object's prototype.\n\n##Summary\nReturns a reference to the Object function that created the instance's prototype. Note that the value of this property is a reference to the function itself, not a string containing the function's name. The value is only read-only for primitive values such as 1, true and \"test\".\n\n##Description\n\nAll objects inherit a constructor property from their prototype:\n\n\tvar o = {};\n\to.constructor === Object; // true\n\n\tvar a = [];\n\ta.constructor === Array; // true\n\n\tvar n = new Number(3);\n\tn.constructor === Number; // true\n\n##Examples\n\n###Example: Displaying the constructor of an object\n\nThe following example creates a prototype, Tree, and an object of that type, theTree. The example then displays the constructor property for the object theTree.\n\n\tfunction Tree(name) {\n\t  this.name = name;\n\t}\n\n\tvar theTree = new Tree('Redwood');\n\tconsole.log('theTree.constructor is ' + theTree.constructor);\n\tThis example displays the following output:\n\n\ttheTree.constructor is function Tree(name) {\n\t  this.name = name;\n\t}\n\n###Example: Changing the constructor of an object\n\nThe following example shows how to modify constructor value of generic objects. Only true, 1 and \"test\" will not be affected as they have read-only native constructors. This example shows that it is not always safe to rely on the constructor property of an object.\n\n\tfunction Type () {}\n\n\tvar types = [\n\t  new Array(),\n\t  [],\n\t  new Boolean(),\n\t  true,             // remains unchanged\n\t  new Date(),\n\t  new Error(),\n\t  new Function(),\n\t  function () {},\n\t  Math,\n\t  new Number(),\n\t  1,                // remains unchanged\n\t  new Object(),\n\t  {},\n\t  new RegExp(),\n\t  /(?:)/,\n\t  new String(),\n\t  'test'            // remains unchanged\n\t];\n\tfor (var i = 0; i < types.length; i++) {\n\t  types[i].constructor = Type;\n\t  types[i] = [types[i].constructor, types[i] instanceof Type, types[i].toString()];\n\t}\n\tconsole.log(types.join('\\n'));\n\tThis example displays the following output:\n\n\tfunction Type() {},false,\n\tfunction Type() {},false,\n\tfunction Type() {},false,false\n\tfunction Boolean() {\n\t    [native code]\n\t},false,true\n\tfunction Type() {},false,Mon Sep 01 2014 16:03:49 GMT+0600\n\tfunction Type() {},false,Error\n\tfunction Type() {},false,function anonymous() {\n\n\t}\n\tfunction Type() {},false,function () {}\n\tfunction Type() {},false,[object Math]\n\tfunction Type() {},false,0\n\tfunction Number() {\n\t    [native code]\n\t},false,1\n\tfunction Type() {},false,[object Object]\n\tfunction Type() {},false,[object Object]\n\tfunction Type() {},false,/(?:)/\n\tfunction Type() {},false,/(?:)/\n\tfunction Type() {},false,\n\tfunction String() {\n\t    [native code]\n\t},false,тест\n\n*/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/*\n@property {Object} __proto__ \nPoints to the object which was used as prototype when the object was instantiated.\n\n@property {Function} __noSuchMethod__ \nAllows a function to be defined that will be executed when an undefined object member is called as a method.\n*/\n\n\n\n/* \n@module javascript\n\n@class String\n\n#Summary\nThe String global object is a constructor for strings, or a sequence of characters.\n\n#Syntax\nString literals take the forms:\n\n\t'string text' \"string text\" \"中文 español English हिन्दी العربية português বাংলা русский 日本語 ਪੰਜਾਬੀ 한국어\"\n\nBeside regular, printable characters, special characters can be encoded using escape notation:\n\n\tCode\tOutput\n\t\\0\tthe NUL character\n\t\\'\tsingle quote\n\t\\\"\tdouble quote\n\t\\\\\tbackslash\n\t\\n\tnew line\n\t\\r\tcarriage return\n\t\\v\tvertical tab\n\t\\t\ttab\n\t\\b\tbackspace\n\t\\f\tform feed\n\t\\uXXXX\tunicode codepoint\n\t\\xXX\tthe Latin-1 character\n\nOr, using the String global object directly:\n\n\tString(thing) new String(thing)\n\n#Description\nStrings are useful for holding data that can be represented in text form. Some of the most-used operations on strings are to check their length, to build and concatenate them using the + and += string operators, checking for the existence or location of substrings with the indexOf method, or extracting substrings with the substring method.\n\n##Character access\n\nThere are two ways to access an individual character in a string. The first is the charAt method:\n\n\treturn 'cat'.charAt(1); // returns \"a\"\n\nThe other way (introduced in ECMAScript 5) is to treat the string as an array-like object, where individual characters correspond to a numerical index:\n\n\treturn 'cat'[1]; // returns \"a\"\n\nFor character access using bracket notation, attempting to delete or assign a value to these properties will not succeed. The properties involved are neither writable nor configurable. (See Object.defineProperty for more information.)\n\n##Comparing strings\n\nC developers have the strcmp() function for comparing strings. In JavaScript, you just use the less-than and greater-than operators:\n\n\tvar a = \"a\";\n\tvar b = \"b\";\n\tif (a < b) // true\n\t  print(a + \" is less than \" + b);\n\telse if (a > b)\n\t  print(a + \" is greater than \" + b);\n\telse\n\t  print(a + \" and \" + b + \" are equal.\");\n\nA similar result can be achieved using the localeCompare method inherited by String instances.\n\n##Distinction between string primitives and String objects\n\nNote that JavaScript distinguishes between String objects and primitive string values. (The same is true of Boolean and Numbers.)\n\nString literals (denoted by double or single quotes) and strings returned from String calls in a non-constructor context (i.e., without using the new keyword) are primitive strings. JavaScript automatically converts primitives to String objects, so that it's possible to use String object methods for primitive strings. In contexts where a method is to be invoked on a primitive string or a property lookup occurs, JavaScript will automatically wrap the string primitive and call the method or perform the property lookup.\n\n\tvar s_prim = \"foo\";\n\tvar s_obj = new String(s_prim);\n\n\tconsole.log(typeof s_prim); // Logs \"string\"\n\tconsole.log(typeof s_obj);  // Logs \"object\"\n\tString primitives and String objects also give different results when using eval. Primitives passed to eval are treated as source code; String objects are treated as all other objects are, by returning the object. For example:\n\n\ts1 = \"2 + 2\";               // creates a string primitive\n\ts2 = new String(\"2 + 2\");   // creates a String object\n\tconsole.log(eval(s1));      // returns the number 4\n\tconsole.log(eval(s2));      // returns the string \"2 + 2\"\n\nFor these reasons, code may break when it encounters String objects when it expects a primitive string instead, although generally authors need not worry about the distinction.\n\nA String object can always be converted to its primitive counterpart with the valueOf method.\n\n\tconsole.log(eval(s2.valueOf())); // returns the number 4\n\nNote: For another possible approach to strings in JavaScript, please read the article about StringView – a C-like representation of strings based on typed arrays.\n\n\n#String generic methods\nThe String instance methods are also available in Firefox as of JavaScript 1.6 (though not part of the ECMAScript standard) on the String object for applying String methods to any object:\n\n\tvar num = 15;\n\talert(String.replace(num, /5/, '2'));\n\nGenerics are also available on Array methods.\n\nThe following is a shim to provide support to non-supporting browsers:\n\n\t//globals define\n\t// Assumes all supplied String instance methods already present\n\t// (one may use shims for these if not available)\n\t(function () {\n\t    'use strict';\n\n\t    var i,\n\t        // We could also build the array of methods with the following, but the\n\t        //   getOwnPropertyNames() method is non-shimable:\n\t        // Object.getOwnPropertyNames(String).filter(function (methodName)\n\t        //  {return typeof String[methodName] === 'function'});\n\t        methods = [\n\t            'quote', 'substring', 'toLowerCase', 'toUpperCase', 'charAt',\n\t            'charCodeAt', 'indexOf', 'lastIndexOf', 'startsWith', 'endsWith',\n\t            'trim', 'trimLeft', 'trimRight', 'toLocaleLowerCase',\n\t            'toLocaleUpperCase', 'localeCompare', 'match', 'search',\n\t            'replace', 'split', 'substr', 'concat', 'slice'\n\t        ],\n\t        methodCount = methods.length,\n\t        assignStringGeneric = function (methodName) {\n\t            var method = String.prototype[methodName];\n\t            String[methodName] = function (arg1) {\n\t                return method.apply(arg1, Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1));\n\t            };\n\t        };\n\n\t    for (i = 0; i < methodCount; i++) {\n\t        assignStringGeneric(methods[i]);\n\t    }\n\t}());\n\n#Examples\n##String conversion\n\nIt's possible to use String as a \"safer\" toString alternative, as although it still normally calls the underlying toString, it also works for null and undefined. For example:\n\n\tvar outputStrings = [];\n\tfor (let i = 0, n = inputValues.length; i < n; ++i) {\n\t  outputStrings.push(String(inputValues[i]));\n\t}\n\n*/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/*\n@property {Number} length\n\n#Summary\nThe length property represents the length of a string.\n\n#Syntax\n\n\tstr.length\n\n#Description\n\nThis property returns the number of code units in the string.

The first 128 Unicode code points are a direct match of the ASCII character encoding. For information on Unicode, see the JavaScript Guide.\n\nNote that charCodeAt will always return a value that is less than 65,536. This is because the higher code points are represented by a pair of (lower valued) \"surrogate\" pseudo-characters which are used to comprise the real character. Because of this, in order to examine or reproduce the full character for individual characters of value 65,536 and above, for such characters, it is necessary to retrieve not only charCodeAt(i), but also charCodeAt(i+1) (as if examining/reproducing a string with two letters). See example 2 and 3 below.\n\ncharCodeAt returns NaN if the given index is not greater than 0 or is greater than the length of the string.\n\nBackward compatibilty: In historic versions (like JavaScript 1.2) the charCodeAt method returns a number indicating the ISO-Latin-1 codeset value of the character at the given index. The ISO-Latin-1 codeset ranges from 0 to 255. The first 0 to 127 are a direct match of the ASCII character set.\n\n#Examples\n##Example: Using charCodeAt\n\nThe following example returns 65, the Unicode value for A.\n\n\t\"ABC\".charCodeAt(0) // returns 65\n\n#Example: Fixing charCodeAt to handle non-Basic-Multilingual-Plane characters if their presence earlier in the string is unknown\n\nThis version might be used in for loops and the like when it is unknown whether non-BMP characters exist before the specified index position.\n\n\tfunction fixedCharCodeAt (str, idx) {\n\t    // ex. fixedCharCodeAt ('\\uD800\\uDC00', 0); // 65536\n\t    // ex. fixedCharCodeAt ('\\uD800\\uDC00', 1); // false\n\t    idx = idx || 0;\n\t    var code = str.charCodeAt(idx);\n\t    var hi, low;\n\t    \n\t    // High surrogate (could change last hex to 0xDB7F to treat high\n\t    // private surrogates as single characters)\n\t    if (0xD800 <= code && code <= 0xDBFF) {\n\t        hi = code;\n\t        low = str.charCodeAt(idx+1);\n\t        if (isNaN(low)) {\n\t            throw 'High surrogate not followed by low surrogate in fixedCharCodeAt()';\n\t        }\n\t        return ((hi - 0xD800) * 0x400) + (low - 0xDC00) + 0x10000;\n\t    }\n\t    if (0xDC00 <= code && code <= 0xDFFF) { // Low surrogate\n\t        // We return false to allow loops to skip this iteration since should have\n\t        // already handled high surrogate above in the previous iteration\n\t        return false;\n\t        //hi = str.charCodeAt(idx-1);\n\t        //low = code;\n\t        //return ((hi - 0xD800) * 0x400) + (low - 0xDC00) + 0x10000;\n\t    }\n\t    return code;\n\t}\n\n##Example: Fixing charCodeAt to handle non-Basic-Multilingual-Plane characters if their presence earlier in the string is known\n\n\tfunction knownCharCodeAt (str, idx) {\n\t    str += '';\n\t    var code,\n\t        end = str.length;\n\n\t    var surrogatePairs = /[\\uD800-\\uDBFF][\\uDC00-\\uDFFF]/g;\n\t    while ((surrogatePairs.exec(str)) != null) {\n\t        var li = surrogatePairs.lastIndex;\n\t        if (li - 2 < idx) {\n\t            idx++;\n\t        }\n\t        else {\n\t            break;\n\t        }\n\t    }\n\n\t    if (idx >= end || idx < 0) {\n\t        return NaN;\n\t    }\n\n\t    code = str.charCodeAt(idx);\n\n\t    var hi, low;\n\t    if (0xD800 <= code && code <= 0xDBFF) {\n\t        hi = code;\n\t        low = str.charCodeAt(idx+1);\n\t        // Go one further, since one of the \"characters\" is part of a surrogate pair\n\t        return ((hi - 0xD800) * 0x400) + (low - 0xDC00) + 0x10000;\n\t    }\n\t    return code;\n\t}\n\n\n@param {Number} index\nAn integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than the length of the string; if it is not a number, it defaults to 0.\n\n@returns {Number}returns the numeric Unicode value of the character at the given index (except for unicode codepoints > 0x10000).\n\n*/\n\n\n\n\n\n/*\n@method concat\n\n\n#Summary\nThe concat() method combines the text of two or more strings and returns a new string.\n\n#Syntax\n\tstr.concat(string2, string3[, ..., stringN])\n\n#Description\nThe concat function combines the text from one or more strings and returns a new string.

For example, the following expression returns -1:\n\n\"Blue Whale\".indexOf(\"blue\") // returns -1\n##Checking occurrences\n\nNote that '0' doesn't evaluate to true and '-1' doesn't evaluate to false.

The variables contain the same string except that the second string contains uppercase letters. The first log method displays 19. But because the indexOf method is case sensitive, the string \"cheddar\" is not found in myCapString, so the second log method displays -1.\n\n\tvar myString    = \"brie, pepper jack, cheddar\";\n\tvar myCapString = \"Brie, Pepper Jack, Cheddar\";\n\n\tconsole.log('myString.indexOf(\"cheddar\") is ' + myString.indexOf(\"cheddar\"));    \n\t// Displays 19\n\tconsole.log('myCapString.indexOf(\"cheddar\") is ' + myCapString.indexOf(\"cheddar\")); \n\t// Displays -1\n##Example: Using indexOf to count occurrences of a letter in a string\n\nThe following example sets count to the number of occurrences of the letter x in the string str:\n\n\tcount = 0;\n\tpos = str.indexOf(\"x\");\n\n\twhile ( pos != -1 ) {\n\t   count++;\n\t   pos = str.indexOf( \"x\",pos + 1 );\n\t}\n\n\n@param {String} searchValue A string representing the value to search for.\n@param {Number} fromIndex The location within the calling string to start the search from.

You're also free to trigger your own events on Models, Collections and Views as you see fit. The Backbone object itself mixes in Events, and can be used to emit any global events that your application needs.\n\n\t\"add\" (model, collection, options) — when a model is added to a collection.\n\t\"remove\" (model, collection, options) — when a model is removed from a collection.\n\t\"reset\" (collection, options) — when the collection's entire contents have been replaced.\n\t\"sort\" (collection, options) — when the collection has been re-sorted.\n\t\"change\" (model, options) — when a model's attributes have changed.\n\t\"change:[attribute]\" (model, value, options) — when a specific attribute has been updated.\n\t\"destroy\" (model, collection, options) — when a model is destroyed.\n\t\"request\" (model_or_collection, xhr, options) — when a model or collection has started a request to the server.\n\t\"sync\" (model_or_collection, resp, options) — when a model or collection has been successfully synced with the server.\n\t\"error\" (model_or_collection, resp, options) — when model's or collection's request to remote server has failed.\n\t\"invalid\" (model, error, options) — when a model's validation fails on the client.\n\t\"route:[name]\" (params) — Fired by the router when a specific route is matched.\n\t\"route\" (route, params) — Fired by the router when any route has been matched.\n\t\"route\" (router, route, params) — Fired by history when any route has been matched.\n\t\"all\" — this special event fires for any triggered event, passing the event name as the first argument.\nGenerally speaking, when calling a function that emits an event (model.set, collection.add, and so on...), if you'd like to prevent the event from being triggered, you may pass {silent: true} as an option. Note that this is rarely, perhaps even never, a good idea.

The event string may also be a space-delimited list of several events...\n\n\tbook.on(\"change:title change:author\", ...);\n\nTo supply a context value for this when the callback is invoked, pass the optional third argument: model.on('change', this.render, this)\n\nCallbacks bound to the special \"all\" event will be triggered when any event occurs, and are passed the name of the event as the first argument. For example, to proxy all events from one object to another:\n\n\tproxy.on(\"all\", function(eventName) {\n\t  object.trigger(eventName);\n\t});\nAll Backbone event methods also support an event map syntax, as an alternative to positional arguments:\n\n\tbook.on({\n\t  \"change:title\": titleView.update,\n\t  \"change:author\": authorPane.update,\n\t  \"destroy\": bookView.remove\n\t});\n\n@param {String} event\n@param {Function} callback\n@param {Object} context optional\n*/\n\n\n\n/*\n@method off\nRemove a previously-bound callback function from an object.

Backbone is available for use under the MIT software license.\n\nYou can report bugs and discuss features on the GitHub issues page, on Freenode IRC in the #documentcloud channel, post questions to the Google Group, add pages to the wiki or send tweets to @documentcloud.\n\nBackbone is an open-source component of DocumentCloud.\n\n#Dependencies\nBackbone's only hard dependency is Underscore.js ( >= 1.5.0). For RESTful persistence, history support via Backbone.Router and DOM manipulation with Backbone.View, include jQuery, and json2.js for older Internet Explorer support. (Mimics of the Underscore and jQuery APIs, such as Lo-Dash and Zepto, will also tend to work, with varying degrees of compatibility.)\n\n#Introduction\n\nWhen working on a web application that involves a lot of JavaScript, one of the first things you learn is to stop tying your data to the DOM. It's all too easy to create JavaScript applications that end up as tangled piles of jQuery selectors and callbacks, all trying frantically to keep data in sync between the HTML UI, your JavaScript logic, and the database on your server. For rich client-side applications, a more structured approach is often helpful.\n\nWith Backbone, you represent your data as Models, which can be created, validated, destroyed, and saved to the server. Whenever a UI action causes an attribute of a model to change, the model triggers a \"change\" event; all the Views that display the model's state can be notified of the change, so that they are able to respond accordingly, re-rendering themselves with the new information. In a finished Backbone app, you don't have to write the glue code that looks into the DOM to find an element with a specific id, and update the HTML manually — when the model changes, the views simply update themselves.\n\nPhilosophically, Backbone is an attempt to discover the minimal set of data-structuring (models and collections) and user interface (views and URLs) primitives that are generally useful when building web applications with JavaScript. In an ecosystem where overarching, decides-everything-for-you frameworks are commonplace, and many libraries require your site to be reorganized to suit their look, feel, and default behavior — Backbone should continue to be a tool that gives you the freedom to design the full experience of your web application.\n\nIf you're new here, and aren't yet quite sure what Backbone is for, start by browsing the list of Backbone-based projects.\n\n*/\n\n//@class BackboneView\n//@property {jQuery} $el\n//@property {jQuery} $\n//@property {HTMLElement} el\n//@method render\n\n//@class BackboneRouter\n//@class BackboneModel\n\n/*@module html \n\n\n@class HTMLElement @extends XMLNode\n\n#Events \n\nTaken from http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_eventattributes.asp\n\nHTML 4 added the ability to let events trigger actions in a browser, like starting a JavaScript when a user clicks on an element.\n\n\n\n\n\n@event onafterprint\t\tScript to be run after the document is printed\n\n@event onbeforeprint\tScript to be run before the document is printed.

It can register multiple callbacks into callback queues, invoke callback queues, and relay the success or failure state of any synchronous or asynchronous function.\n\nThe Deferred object is chainable, similar to the way a jQuery object is chainable, but it has its own methods. After creating a Deferred object, you can use any of the methods below by either chaining directly from the object creation or saving the object in a variable and invoking one or more methods on that variable.\n\n*/\n\n/*\n@constructor jQuery.Deferred\n\n##Description\n\nA constructor function that returns a chainable utility object with methods to register multiple callbacks into callback queues, invoke callback queues, and relay the success or failure state of any synchronous or asynchronous function.\n\nThe jQuery.Deferred method can be passed an optional function, which is called just before the constructor returns and is passed the constructed deferred object as both the this object and as the first argument to the function. The called function can attach callbacks using deferred.then(), for example.\n\nA Deferred object starts in the pending state. Any callbacks added to the object with deferred.then(), deferred.always(), deferred.done(), or deferred.fail() are queued to be executed later. Calling deferred.resolve() or deferred.resolveWith() transitions the Deferred into the resolved state and immediately executes any doneCallbacks that are set. Calling deferred.reject() or deferred.rejectWith() transitions the Deferred into the rejected state and immediately executes any failCallbacks that are set. Once the object has entered the resolved or rejected state, it stays in that state. Callbacks can still be added to the resolved or rejected Deferred — they will execute immediately.\n\n##Enhanced Callbacks with jQuery Deferred\n\nIn JavaScript it is common to invoke functions that optionally accept callbacks that are called within that function. For example, in versions prior to jQuery 1.5, asynchronous processes such as jQuery.ajax() accept callbacks to be invoked some time in the near-future upon success, error, and completion of the ajax request.\n\njQuery.Deferred() introduces several enhancements to the way callbacks are managed and invoked. In particular, jQuery.Deferred() provides flexible ways to provide multiple callbacks, and these callbacks can be invoked regardless of whether the original callback dispatch has already occurred. jQuery Deferred is based on the CommonJS Promises/A design.\n\nOne model for understanding Deferred is to think of it as a chain-aware function wrapper. The deferred.then(), deferred.always(), deferred.done(), and deferred.fail() methods specify the functions to be called and the deferred.resolve(args) or deferred.reject(args) methods \"call\" the functions with the arguments you supply. Once the Deferred has been resolved or rejected it stays in that state; a second call to deferred.resolve(), for example, is ignored. If more functions are added by deferred.then(), for example, after the Deferred is resolved, they are called immediately with the arguments previously provided.\n\nIn most cases where a jQuery API call returns a Deferred or Promise-compatible object, such as jQuery.ajax() or jQuery.when(), you will only want to use the deferred.then(), deferred.done(), and deferred.fail() methods to add callbacks to the Deferred's queues. The internals of the API call or code that created the Deferred will invoke deferred.resolve() or deferred.reject() on the deferred at some point, causing the appropriate callbacks to run.\n\n\n@param {Function}beforeStart Optional\nType: Function( Deferred deferred )\nA function that is called just before the constructor returns.\nThe jQuery.Deferred() constructor creates a new Deferred object. The new operator is optional.\n\n*/\n\n\n\n\n\n/*\n@method always\n\nUsage:\n\tdeferred.always( alwaysCallbacks [, alwaysCallbacks ] )\n\nDescription: Add handlers to be called when the Deferred object is either resolved or rejected.\n\nThe argument can be either a single function or an array of functions. When the Deferred is resolved or rejected, the alwaysCallbacks are called. Since deferred.always() returns the Deferred object, other methods of the Deferred object can be chained to this one, including additional .always() methods. When the Deferred is resolved or rejected, callbacks are executed in the order they were added, using the arguments provided to the resolve, reject, resolveWith or rejectWith method calls. For more information, see the documentation for Deferred object.\n\nExample:\nSince the jQuery.get() method returns a jqXHR object, which is derived from a Deferred object, we can attach a callback for both success and error using the deferred.always() method.\n\n\t$.get( \"test.php\" ).always(function() {\n\t  alert( \"$.get completed with success or error callback arguments\" );\n\t})\n\n@param {Function|Array<Function>} alwaysCallbacks A function, or array of functions, that is called when the Deferred is resolved or rejected.\n\n*/\n\n/*\n@module jquery\n@class jQuery\n*/\n\n\n\n/*@module xml.dom\n@class XMLDocument\n\nXML DOM - The Document Object\n\nThe Document object represents the entire XML document.\n\nThe Document object is the root of a document tree, and gives us the primary access to the document's data.\n\nSince element nodes, text nodes, comments, processing instructions, etc. cannot exist outside the document, the Document object also contains methods to create these objects.

The common way to do this is demonstrated below.\n\nNote that the thrown MyError will report incorrect lineNumber and fileName at least in Firefox.\nSee also the \"What's a good way to extend Error in JavaScript?\" discussion on Stackoverflow.\n\n\t// Create a new object, that prototypally inherits from the Error constructor.\n\tfunction MyError(message) {\n\t  this.name = \"MyError\";\n\t  this.message = message || \"Default Message\";\n\t}\n\tMyError.prototype = new Error();\n\tMyError.prototype.constructor = MyError;\n\n\ttry {\n\t  throw new MyError();\n\t} catch (e) {\n\t  console.log(e.name);     // \"MyError\"\n\t  console.log(e.message);  // \"Default Message\"\n\t}\n\n\ttry {\n\t  throw new MyError(\"custom message\");\n\t} catch (e) {\n\t  console.log(e.name);     // \"MyError\"\n\t  console.log(e.message);  // \"custom message\"\n\t}","commentRange":[4126,8860],"fileName":"ALL.js","module":{"annotation":"module","name":"javascript","text":"","commentRange":[4126,8860],"fileName":"ALL.js"},"absoluteName":"javascript.Error","constructors":[{"annotation":"constructor","name":"n","text":"Boolean","children":[{"annotation":"param","type":"{String}","name":"message","text":"Human-readable description of the error","theRestString":"@param {String} fileName The value for the fileName property on the created Error object.

With apply, you can write a method once and then inherit it in another object, without having to rewrite the method for the new object.\n\napply is very similar to call(), except for the type of arguments it supports. You can use an arguments array instead of a named set of parameters. With apply, you can use an array literal, for example, fun.apply(this, ['eat', 'bananas']), or an Array object, for example, fun.apply(this, new Array('eat', 'bananas')).\n\nYou can also use arguments for the argsArray parameter. arguments is a local variable of a function. It can be used for all unspecified arguments of the called object. Thus, you do not have to know the arguments of the called object when you use the apply method. You can use arguments to pass all the arguments to the called object. The called object is then responsible for handling the arguments.\n\nSince ECMAScript 5th Edition you can also use any kind of object which is array-like, so in practice this means it's going to have a property length and integer properties in the range [0...length). As an example you can now use a NodeList or a own custom object like {'length': 2, '0': 'eat', '1': 'bananas'}.\n\nNote: Most browsers, including Chrome 14 and Internet Explorer 9, still do not accept array-like objects and will throw an exception.\n#Examples\nUsing apply to chain constructors\n\nYou can use apply to chain constructors for an object, similar to Java. In the following example we will create a global Function method called construct, which will make you able to use an array-like object with a constructor instead of an arguments list.\n\n\tFunction.prototype.construct = function (aArgs) {\n\t    var fConstructor = this, fNewConstr = function () { fConstructor.apply(this, aArgs); };\n\t    fNewConstr.prototype = fConstructor.prototype;\n\t    return new fNewConstr();\n\t};\n\nExample usage:\n\n\tfunction MyConstructor () {\n\t    for (var nProp = 0; nProp < arguments.length; nProp++) {\n\t        this[\"property\" + nProp] = arguments[nProp];\n\t    }\n\t}\n\n\tvar myArray = [4, \"Hello world!\", false];\n\tvar myInstance = MyConstructor.construct(myArray);\n\n\talert(myInstance.property1); // alerts \"Hello world!\"\n\talert(myInstance instanceof MyConstructor); // alerts \"true\"\n\talert(myInstance.constructor); // alerts \"MyConstructor\"\n\nNote: This non-native Function.construct method will not work with some native constructors (like Date, for example). In these cases you have to use the Function.bind method (for example, imagine to have an array like the following, to be used with Date constructor: [2012, 11, 4]; in this case you have to write something like: new (Function.prototype.bind.apply(Date, [null].concat([2012, 11, 4])))() – anyhow this is not the best way to do things and probably should not be used in any production environment).\nUsing apply and built-in functions\n\nClever usage of apply allows you to use built-ins functions for some tasks that otherwise probably would have been written by looping over the array values. As an example here we are going to use Math.max/Math.min to find out the maximum/minimum value in an array.\n\n\t//min/max number in an array \n\tvar numbers = [5, 6, 2, 3, 7];\n\n\t//using Math.min/Math.max apply \n\tvar max = Math.max.apply(null, numbers); // This about equal to Math.max(numbers[0], ...) or Math.max(5, 6, ..) \n\tvar min = Math.min.apply(null, numbers);\n\n\t/ vs. simple loop based algorithm \n\tmax = -Infinity, min = +Infinity;\n\n\tfor (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {\n\t  if (numbers[i] > max)\n\t    max = numbers[i];\n\t  if (numbers[i] < min) \n\t    min = numbers[i];\n\t}\n\nBut beware: in using apply this way, you run the risk of exceeding the JavaScript engine's argument length limit. The consequences of applying a function with too many arguments (think more than tens of thousands of arguments) vary across engines (JavaScriptCore has hard-coded argument limit of 65536), because the limit (indeed even the nature of any excessively-large-stack behavior) is unspecified. Some engines will throw an exception. More perniciously, others will arbitrarily limit the number of arguments actually passed to the applied function. (To illustrate this latter case: if such an engine had a limit of four arguments [actual limits are of course significantly higher], it would be as if the arguments 5, 6, 2, 3 had been passed to apply in the examples above, rather than the full array.) If your value array might grow into the tens of thousands, use a hybrid strategy: apply your function to chunks of the array at a time:\n\n\tfunction minOfArray(arr) {\n\t  var min = Infinity;\n\t  var QUANTUM = 32768;\n\n\t  for (var i = 0, len = arr.length; i < len; i += QUANTUM) {\n\t    var submin = Math.min.apply(null, arr.slice(i, Math.min(i + QUANTUM, len)));\n\t    min = Math.min(submin, min);\n\t  }\n\n\t  return min;\n\t}\n\n\tvar min = minOfArray([5, 6, 2, 3, 7]);\nUsing apply in \"monkey-patching\"\n\nApply can be the best way to monkey-patch a builtin function of Firefox, or JS libraries. Given someobject.foo function, you can modify the function in a somewhat hacky way, like so:\n\n\tvar originalfoo = someobject.foo;\n\tsomeobject.foo = function() {\n\t  //Do stuff before calling function\n\t  console.log(arguments);\n\t  //Call the function as it would have been called normally:\n\t  originalfoo.apply(this,arguments);\n\t  //Run stuff after, here.\n\t}\n\nThis method is especially handy where you want to debug events, or interface with something that has no API like the various .on([event]... events, such as those usable on the Devtools Inspector).","children":[{"annotation":"param","type":"{Object}","name":"thisArg","text":"The value of this provided for the call to fun.

A bound function may also be constructed using the new operator: doing so acts as though the target function had instead been constructed. The provided this value is ignored, while prepended arguments are provided to the emulated function.\n\n#Examples\nCreating a bound function\n\nThe simplest use of bind() is to make a function that, no matter how it is called, is called with a particular this value. A common mistake for new JavaScript programmers is to extract a method from an object, then to later call that function and expect it to use the original object as its this (e.g. by using that method in callback-based code). Without special care, however, the original object is usually lost. Creating a bound function from the function, using the original object, neatly solves this problem:\n\n\tthis.x = 9; \n\tvar module = {\n\t  x: 81,\n\t  getX: function() { return this.x; }\n\t};\n\n\tmodule.getX(); // 81\n\n\tvar getX = module.getX;\n\tgetX(); // 9, because in this case, \"this\" refers to the global object\n\n\t// create a new function with 'this' bound to module\n\tvar boundGetX = getX.bind(module);\n\tboundGetX(); // 81\n\n##Partial Functions\n\nThe next simplest use of bind() is to make a function with pre-specified initial arguments. These arguments (if any) follow the provided this value and are then inserted at the start of the arguments passed to the target function, followed by the arguments passed to the bound function, whenever the bound function is called.\n\n\tfunction list() {\n\t  return Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);\n\t}\n\n\tvar list1 = list(1, 2, 3); // [1, 2, 3]\n\n\t//  Create a function with a preset leading argument\n\tvar leadingThirtysevenList = list.bind(undefined, 37);\n\n\tvar list2 = leadingThirtysevenList(); // [37]\n\tvar list3 = leadingThirtysevenList(1, 2, 3); // [37, 1, 2, 3]\n\n##With setTimeout\n\nBy default within window.setTimeout(), the this keyword will be set to the window (or global) object. When working with class methods that require this to refer to class instances, you may explicitly bind this to the callback function, in order to maintain the instance.\n\n\tfunction LateBloomer() {\n\t  this.petalCount = Math.ceil( Math.random() * 12 ) + 1;\n\t}\n\n\t// declare bloom after a delay of 1 second\n\tLateBloomer.prototype.bloom = function() {\n\t  window.setTimeout( this.declare.bind( this ), 1000 );\n\t};\n\n\tLateBloomer.prototype.declare = function() {\n\t  console.log('I am a beautiful flower with ' + \n\t    this.petalCount + ' petals!');\n\t};\n\n##Bound functions used as constructors\n\nWarning: This section demonstrates JavaScript capabilities and documents some edge cases of the bind() method. The methods shown below are not the best way to do things and probably should not be used in any production environment.\nBound functions are automatically suitable for use with the new operator to construct new instances created by the target function. When a bound function is used to construct a value, the provided this is ignored. However, provided arguments are still prepended to the constructor call:\n\n\tfunction Point(x, y) {\n\t  this.x = x;\n\t  this.y = y;\n\t}\n\n\tPoint.prototype.toString = function() { \n\t  return this.x + \",\" + this.y; \n\t};\n\n\tvar p = new Point(1, 2);\n\tp.toString(); // \"1,2\"\n\n\n\tvar emptyObj = {};\n\tvar YAxisPoint = Point.bind(emptyObj, 0);\n\t// not supported in the polyfill below, works fine with native bind:\n\tvar YAxisPoint = Point.bind(null,0 );\n\n\tvar axisPoint = new YAxisPoint(5);\n\taxisPoint.toString(); //  \"0,5\"\n\n\taxisPoint instanceof Point; // true\n\taxisPoint instanceof YAxisPoint; // true\n\tnew Point(17, 42) instanceof YAxisPoint; // false\nNote that you need do nothing special to create a bound function for use with new. The corollary is that you need do nothing special to create a bound function to be called plainly, even if you would rather require the bound function to only be called using new.\n\n\t// Example can be run directly in your JavaScript console\n\t// ...continuing from above\n\n\t// Can still be called as a normal function \n\t// (although usually this is undesired)\n\tYAxisPoint(13);\n\n\temptyObj.x + \",\" + emptyObj.y;\n\t// >  \"0,13\"\nIf you wish to support use of a bound function only using new, or only by calling it, the target function must enforce that restriction.\n\n##Creating shortcuts\n\nbind() is also helpful in cases where you want to create a shortcut to a function which requires a specific this value.\n\nTake Array.prototype.slice, for example, which you want to use for converting an array-like object to a real array. You could create a shortcut like this:\n\n\tvar slice = Array.prototype.slice;\n\n\t// ...\n\n\tslice.call(arguments);\n\tWith bind(), this can be simplified. In the following piece of code, slice is a bound function to the call() function of Function.prototype, with the this value set to the slice() function of Array.prototype. This means that additional call() calls can be eliminated:\n\n\t// same as \"slice\" in the previous example\n\tvar unboundSlice = Array.prototype.slice;\n\tvar slice = Function.prototype.call.bind(unboundSlice);\n\n\t// ...\n\n\tslice(arguments);\n#Polyfill\nThe bind function is a recent addition to ECMA-262, 5th edition; as such it may not be present in all browsers. You can partially work around this by inserting the following code at the beginning of your scripts, allowing use of much of the functionality of bind() in implementations that do not natively support it.\n\n\tif (!Function.prototype.bind) {\n\t  Function.prototype.bind = function (oThis) {\n\t    if (typeof this !== \"function\") {\n\t      // closest thing possible to the ECMAScript 5\n\t      // internal IsCallable function\n\t      throw new TypeError(\"Function.prototype.bind - what is trying to be bound is not callable\");\n\t    }\n\n\t    var aArgs = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1), \n\t        fToBind = this, \n\t        fNOP = function () {},\n\t        fBound = function () {\n\t          return fToBind.apply(this instanceof fNOP && oThis\n\t                 ? this\n\t                 : oThis,\n\t                 aArgs.concat(Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)));\n\t        };\n\n\t    fNOP.prototype = this.prototype;\n\t    fBound.prototype = new fNOP();\n\n\t    return fBound;\n\t  };\n\t}\n\nSome of the many differences (there may well be others, as this list does not seriously attempt to be exhaustive) between this algorithm and the specified algorithm are:\n\nThe partial implementation relies Array.prototype.slice, Array.prototype.concat, Function.prototype.call and Function.prototype.apply, built-in methods to have their original values.\nThe partial implementation creates functions that do not have immutable \"poison pill\" caller and arguments properties that throw a TypeError upon get, set, or deletion. (This could be added if the implementation supports Object.defineProperty, or partially implemented [without throw-on-delete behavior] if the implementation supports the __defineGetter__ and __defineSetter__ extensions.)\nThe partial implementation creates functions that have a prototype property. (Proper bound functions have none.)\nThe partial implementation creates bound functions whose length property does not agree with that mandated by ECMA-262: it creates functions with length 0, while a full implementation, depending on the length of the target function and the number of pre-specified arguments, may return a non-zero length.\nIf you choose to use this partial implementation, you must not rely on those cases where behavior deviates from ECMA-262, 5th edition! With some care, however (and perhaps with additional modification to suit specific needs), this partial implementation may be a reasonable bridge to the time when bind() is widely implemented according to the specification.","children":[{"annotation":"param","name":"thisArg","text":"The value to be passed as the this parameter to the target function when the bound function is called.

Normal property addition through assignment creates properties which show up during property enumeration (for...in loop or Object.keys method), whose values may be changed, and which may be deleted. This method allows these extra details to be changed from their defaults.\n\nProperty descriptors present in objects come in two main flavors: data descriptors and accessor descriptors. A data descriptor is a property that has a value, which may or may not be writable. An accessor descriptor is a property described by a getter-setter pair of functions. A descriptor must be one of these two flavors; it cannot be both.\n\nBoth data and accessor descriptors are objects. They share the following optional keys:\n\n###configurable\ntrue if and only if the type of this property descriptor may be changed and if the property may be deleted from the corresponding object.\nDefaults to false.\n\n###enumerable\ntrue if and only if this property shows up during enumeration of the properties on the corresponding object.\nDefaults to false.\nA data descriptor also has the following optional keys:\n\n###value\nThe value associated with the property. Can be any valid JavaScript value (number, object, function, etc).\nDefaults to undefined.\nwritable\ntrue if and only if the value associated with the property may be changed with an assignment operator.\nDefaults to false.\nAn accessor descriptor also has the following optional keys:\n\n###get\nA function which serves as a getter for the property, or undefined if there is no getter. The function return will be used as the value of property.\nDefaults to undefined.\n\n###set\nA function which serves as a setter for the property, or undefined if there is no setter. The function will receive as only argument the new value being assigned to the property.\nDefaults to undefined.\nBear in mind that these options are not necessarily own properties so, if inherited, will be considered too. In order to ensure these defaults are preserved you might freeze the Object.prototype upfront, specify all options explicitly, or point to null as __proto__ property.\n\n\t// using __proto__\n\tObject.defineProperty(obj, 'key', {\n\t  __proto__: null, // no inherited properties\n\t  value: 'static'  // not enumerable\n\t                   // not configurable\n\t                   // not writable\n\t                   // as defaults\n\t});\n\n\t// being explicit\n\tObject.defineProperty(obj, 'key', {\n\t  enumerable: false,\n\t  configurable: false,\n\t  writable: false,\n\t  value: 'static'\n\t});\n\n\t// recycling same object\n\tfunction withValue(value) {\n\t  var d = withValue.d || (\n\t    withValue.d = {\n\t      enumerable: false,\n\t      writable: false,\n\t      configurable: false,\n\t      value: null\n\t    }\n\t  );\n\t  d.value = value;\n\t  return d;\n\t}\n\t// ... and ...\n\tObject.defineProperty(obj, 'key', withValue('static'));\n\n\t// if freeze is available, prevents the code to add\n\t// value, get, set, enumerable, writable, configurable\n\t// to the Object prototype\n\t(Object.freeze || Object)(Object.prototype);\n\n#Examples\n\nIf you want to see how to use the Object.defineProperty method with a binary-flags-like syntax, see additional examples.\n\n##Example: Creating a property\n\nWhen the property specified doesn't exist in the object, Object.defineProperty() creates a new property as described. Fields may be omitted from the descriptor, and default values for those fields are imputed. All of the Boolean-valued fields default to false. The value, get, and set fields default to undefined. A property which is defined without get/set/value/writable is called “generic” and is “typed” as a data descriptor.\n\n\tvar o = {}; // Creates a new object\n\n\t// Example of an object property added with defineProperty with a data property descriptor\n\tObject.defineProperty(o, 'a', {\n\t  value: 37,\n\t  writable: true,\n\t  enumerable: true,\n\t  configurable: true\n\t});\n\t// 'a' property exists in the o object and its value is 37\n\n\t// Example of an object property added with defineProperty with an accessor property descriptor\n\tvar bValue = 38;\n\tObject.defineProperty(o, 'b', {\n\t  get: function() { return bValue; },\n\t  set: function(newValue) { bValue = newValue; },\n\t  enumerable: true,\n\t  configurable: true\n\t});\n\to.b; // 38\n\t// 'b' property exists in the o object and its value is 38\n\t// The value of o.b is now always identical to bValue, unless o.b is redefined\n\n\t// You cannot try to mix both:\n\tObject.defineProperty(o, 'conflict', {\n\t  value: 0x9f91102,\n\t  get: function() { return 0xdeadbeef; }\n\t});\n\t// throws a TypeError: value appears only in data descriptors, get appears only in accessor descriptors\n\n##Example: Modifying a property\n\nWhen the property already exists, Object.defineProperty() attempts to modify the property according to the values in the descriptor and the object's current configuration. If the old descriptor had its configurable attribute set to false (the property is said to be “non-configurable”), then no attribute besides writable can be changed. In that case, it is also not possible to switch back and forth between the data and accessor property types.\n\nIf a property is non-configurable, its writable attribute can only be changed to false.\n\nA TypeError is thrown when attempts are made to change non-configurable property attributes (besides the writable attribute) unless the current and new values are the same.\n\n##Writable attribute\n\nWhen the writable property attribute is set to false, the property is said to be “non-writable”. It cannot be reassigned.\n\n\tvar o = {}; // Creates a new object\n\n\tObject.defineProperty(o, 'a', {\n\t  value: 37,\n\t  writable: false\n\t});\n\n\tconsole.log(o.a); // logs 37\n\to.a = 25; // No error thrown (it would throw in strict mode, even if the value had been the same)\n\tconsole.log(o.a); // logs 37. The assignment didn't work.\n\nAs seen in the example, trying to write into the non-writable property doesn't change it but doesn't throw an error either.\n\n##Enumerable attribute\n\nThe enumerable property attribute defines whether the property shows up in a for...in loop and Object.keys() or not.\n\n\tvar o = {};\n\tObject.defineProperty(o, 'a', { value: 1, enumerable: true });\n\tObject.defineProperty(o, 'b', { value: 2, enumerable: false });\n\tObject.defineProperty(o, 'c', { value: 3 }); // enumerable defaults to false\n\to.d = 4; // enumerable defaults to true when creating a property by setting it\n\n\tfor (var i in o) {\n\t  console.log(i);\n\t}\n\t// logs 'a' and 'd' (in undefined order)\n\n\tObject.keys(o); // ['a', 'd']\n\n\to.propertyIsEnumerable('a'); // true\n\to.propertyIsEnumerable('b'); // false\n\to.propertyIsEnumerable('c'); // false\n\tConfigurable attribute\n\n\tThe configurable attribute controls at the same time whether the property can be deleted from the object and whether its attributes (other than writable) can be changed.\n\n\tvar o = {};\n\tObject.defineProperty(o, 'a', {\n\t  get: function() { return 1; },\n\t  configurable: false\n\t});\n\n\tObject.defineProperty(o, 'a', { configurable: true }); // throws a TypeError\n\tObject.defineProperty(o, 'a', { enumerable: true }); // throws a TypeError\n\tObject.defineProperty(o, 'a', { set: function() {} }); // throws a TypeError (set was undefined previously)\n\tObject.defineProperty(o, 'a', { get: function() { return 1; } }); // throws a TypeError (even though the new get does exactly the same thing)\n\tObject.defineProperty(o, 'a', { value: 12 }); // throws a TypeError\n\n\tconsole.log(o.a); // logs 1\n\tdelete o.a; // Nothing happens\n\tconsole.log(o.a); // logs 1\n\n\nIf the configurable attribute of o.a had been true, none of the errors would be thrown and the property would be deleted at the end.\n\n##Example: Adding properties and default values\n\nIt's important to consider the way default values of attributes are applied. There is often a difference between simply using dot notation to assign a value and using Object.defineProperty(), as shown in the example below.\n\n\tvar o = {};\n\n\to.a = 1;\n\t// is equivalent to:\n\tObject.defineProperty(o, 'a', {\n\t  value: 1,\n\t  writable: true,\n\t  configurable: true,\n\t  enumerable: true\n\t});\n\n\n\t// On the other hand,\n\tObject.defineProperty(o, 'a', { value: 1 });\n\t// is equivalent to:\n\tObject.defineProperty(o, 'a', {\n\t  value: 1,\n\t  writable: false,\n\t  configurable: false,\n\t  enumerable: false\n\t});\n\n\n##Example: Custom Setters and Getters\n\nExample below shows how to implement a self-archiving object. When temperature property is set, the archive array gets a log entry.\n\n\tfunction Archiver() {\n\t  var temperature = null;\n\t  var archive = [];\n\n\t  Object.defineProperty(this, 'temperature', {\n\t    get: function() {\n\t      console.log('get!');\n\t      return temperature;\n\t    },\n\t    set: function(value) {\n\t      temperature = value;\n\t      archive.push({ val: temperature });\n\t    }\n\t  });\n\n\t  this.getArchive = function() { return archive; };\n\t}\n\n\tvar arc = new Archiver();\n\tarc.temperature; // 'get!'\n\tarc.temperature = 11;\n\tarc.temperature = 13;\n\tarc.getArchive(); // [{ val: 11 }, { val: 13 }]","children":[{"annotation":"static","name":"dummy","text":"","theRestString":"@param {Object} obj The object on which to define the property.\n@param {String} prop The name of the property to be defined or modified.\n@param {Object} descriptor The descriptor for the property being defined or modified."},{"annotation":"param","type":"{Object}","name":"obj","text":"The object on which to define the property.","theRestString":"@param {String} prop The name of the property to be defined or modified.\n@param {Object} descriptor The descriptor for the property being defined or modified."},{"annotation":"param","type":"{String}","name":"prop","text":"The name of the property to be defined or modified.","theRestString":"@param {Object} descriptor The descriptor for the property being defined or modified."},{"annotation":"param","type":"{Object}","name":"descriptor","text":"The descriptor for the property being defined or modified.","theRestString":""}],"commentRange":[58227,67721],"fileName":"ALL.js"},"freeze":{"annotation":"method","name":"freeze","text":"#Summary\nThe Object.freeze() method freezes an object: that is, prevents new properties from being added to it; prevents existing properties from being removed; and prevents existing properties, or their enumerability, configurability, or writability, from being changed.

This example shows that it is not always safe to rely on the constructor property of an object.\n\n\tfunction Type () {}\n\n\tvar types = [\n\t  new Array(),\n\t  [],\n\t  new Boolean(),\n\t  true,             // remains unchanged\n\t  new Date(),\n\t  new Error(),\n\t  new Function(),\n\t  function () {},\n\t  Math,\n\t  new Number(),\n\t  1,                // remains unchanged\n\t  new Object(),\n\t  {},\n\t  new RegExp(),\n\t  /(?:)/,\n\t  new String(),\n\t  'test'            // remains unchanged\n\t];\n\tfor (var i = 0; i < types.length; i++) {\n\t  types[i].constructor = Type;\n\t  types[i] = [types[i].constructor, types[i] instanceof Type, types[i].toString()];\n\t}\n\tconsole.log(types.join('\\n'));\n\tThis example displays the following output:\n\n\tfunction Type() {},false,\n\tfunction Type() {},false,\n\tfunction Type() {},false,false\n\tfunction Boolean() {\n\t    [native code]\n\t},false,true\n\tfunction Type() {},false,Mon Sep 01 2014 16:03:49 GMT+0600\n\tfunction Type() {},false,Error\n\tfunction Type() {},false,function anonymous() {\n\n\t}\n\tfunction Type() {},false,function () {}\n\tfunction Type() {},false,[object Math]\n\tfunction Type() {},false,0\n\tfunction Number() {\n\t    [native code]\n\t},false,1\n\tfunction Type() {},false,[object Object]\n\tfunction Type() {},false,[object Object]\n\tfunction Type() {},false,/(?:)/\n\tfunction Type() {},false,/(?:)/\n\tfunction Type() {},false,\n\tfunction String() {\n\t    [native code]\n\t},false,тест","commentRange":[104930,107658],"fileName":"ALL.js"},"__noSuchMethod__":{"annotation":"property","type":"{Function}","name":"__noSuchMethod__","text":"Allows a function to be defined that will be executed when an undefined object member is called as a method.","commentRange":[107666,107933],"fileName":"ALL.js"}}},"javascript.String":{"annotation":"class","name":"String","text":"#Summary\nThe String global object is a constructor for strings, or a sequence of characters.\n\n#Syntax\nString literals take the forms:\n\n\t'string text' \"string text\" \"中文 español English हिन्दी العربية português বাংলা русский 日本語 ਪੰਜਾਬੀ 한국어\"\n\nBeside regular, printable characters, special characters can be encoded using escape notation:\n\n\tCode\tOutput\n\t\\0\tthe NUL character\n\t\\'\tsingle quote\n\t\\\"\tdouble quote\n\t\\\\\tbackslash\n\t\\n\tnew line\n\t\\r\tcarriage return\n\t\\v\tvertical tab\n\t\\t\ttab\n\t\\b\tbackspace\n\t\\f\tform feed\n\t\\uXXXX\tunicode codepoint\n\t\\xXX\tthe Latin-1 character\n\nOr, using the String global object directly:\n\n\tString(thing) new String(thing)\n\n#Description\nStrings are useful for holding data that can be represented in text form. Some of the most-used operations on strings are to check their length, to build and concatenate them using the + and += string operators, checking for the existence or location of substrings with the indexOf method, or extracting substrings with the substring method.\n\n##Character access\n\nThere are two ways to access an individual character in a string. The first is the charAt method:\n\n\treturn 'cat'.charAt(1); // returns \"a\"\n\nThe other way (introduced in ECMAScript 5) is to treat the string as an array-like object, where individual characters correspond to a numerical index:\n\n\treturn 'cat'[1]; // returns \"a\"\n\nFor character access using bracket notation, attempting to delete or assign a value to these properties will not succeed. The properties involved are neither writable nor configurable. (See Object.defineProperty for more information.)\n\n##Comparing strings\n\nC developers have the strcmp() function for comparing strings. In JavaScript, you just use the less-than and greater-than operators:\n\n\tvar a = \"a\";\n\tvar b = \"b\";\n\tif (a < b) // true\n\t  print(a + \" is less than \" + b);\n\telse if (a > b)\n\t  print(a + \" is greater than \" + b);\n\telse\n\t  print(a + \" and \" + b + \" are equal.\");\n\nA similar result can be achieved using the localeCompare method inherited by String instances.\n\n##Distinction between string primitives and String objects\n\nNote that JavaScript distinguishes between String objects and primitive string values. (The same is true of Boolean and Numbers.)\n\nString literals (denoted by double or single quotes) and strings returned from String calls in a non-constructor context (i.e., without using the new keyword) are primitive strings. JavaScript automatically converts primitives to String objects, so that it's possible to use String object methods for primitive strings. In contexts where a method is to be invoked on a primitive string or a property lookup occurs, JavaScript will automatically wrap the string primitive and call the method or perform the property lookup.\n\n\tvar s_prim = \"foo\";\n\tvar s_obj = new String(s_prim);\n\n\tconsole.log(typeof s_prim); // Logs \"string\"\n\tconsole.log(typeof s_obj);  // Logs \"object\"\n\tString primitives and String objects also give different results when using eval. Primitives passed to eval are treated as source code; String objects are treated as all other objects are, by returning the object. For example:\n\n\ts1 = \"2 + 2\";               // creates a string primitive\n\ts2 = new String(\"2 + 2\");   // creates a String object\n\tconsole.log(eval(s1));      // returns the number 4\n\tconsole.log(eval(s2));      // returns the string \"2 + 2\"\n\nFor these reasons, code may break when it encounters String objects when it expects a primitive string instead, although generally authors need not worry about the distinction.\n\nA String object can always be converted to its primitive counterpart with the valueOf method.\n\n\tconsole.log(eval(s2.valueOf())); // returns the number 4\n\nNote: For another possible approach to strings in JavaScript, please read the article about StringView – a C-like representation of strings based on typed arrays.\n\n\n#String generic methods\nThe String instance methods are also available in Firefox as of JavaScript 1.6 (though not part of the ECMAScript standard) on the String object for applying String methods to any object:\n\n\tvar num = 15;\n\talert(String.replace(num, /5/, '2'));\n\nGenerics are also available on Array methods.\n\nThe following is a shim to provide support to non-supporting browsers:\n\n\t//globals define\n\t// Assumes all supplied String instance methods already present\n\t// (one may use shims for these if not available)\n\t(function () {\n\t    'use strict';\n\n\t    var i,\n\t        // We could also build the array of methods with the following, but the\n\t        //   getOwnPropertyNames() method is non-shimable:\n\t        // Object.getOwnPropertyNames(String).filter(function (methodName)\n\t        //  {return typeof String[methodName] === 'function'});\n\t        methods = [\n\t            'quote', 'substring', 'toLowerCase', 'toUpperCase', 'charAt',\n\t            'charCodeAt', 'indexOf', 'lastIndexOf', 'startsWith', 'endsWith',\n\t            'trim', 'trimLeft', 'trimRight', 'toLocaleLowerCase',\n\t            'toLocaleUpperCase', 'localeCompare', 'match', 'search',\n\t            'replace', 'split', 'substr', 'concat', 'slice'\n\t        ],\n\t        methodCount = methods.length,\n\t        assignStringGeneric = function (methodName) {\n\t            var method = String.prototype[methodName];\n\t            String[methodName] = function (arg1) {\n\t                return method.apply(arg1, Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1));\n\t            };\n\t        };\n\n\t    for (i = 0; i < methodCount; i++) {\n\t        assignStringGeneric(methods[i]);\n\t    }\n\t}());\n\n#Examples\n##String conversion\n\nIt's possible to use String as a \"safer\" toString alternative, as although it still normally calls the underlying toString, it also works for null and undefined. For example:\n\n\tvar outputStrings = [];\n\tfor (let i = 0, n = inputValues.length; i < n; ++i) {\n\t  outputStrings.push(String(inputValues[i]));\n\t}","commentRange":[107937,113803],"fileName":"ALL.js","module":{"annotation":"module","name":"javascript","text":"","commentRange":[107937,113803],"fileName":"ALL.js"},"absoluteName":"javascript.String","properties":{"length":{"annotation":"property","type":"{Number}","name":"length","text":"#Summary\nThe length property represents the length of a string.\n\n#Syntax\n\n\tstr.length\n\n#Description\n\nThis property returns the number of code units in the string.

This is because the higher code points are represented by a pair of (lower valued) \"surrogate\" pseudo-characters which are used to comprise the real character. Because of this, in order to examine or reproduce the full character for individual characters of value 65,536 and above, for such characters, it is necessary to retrieve not only charCodeAt(i), but also charCodeAt(i+1) (as if examining/reproducing a string with two letters).

For example, the following expression returns -1:\n\n\"Blue Whale\".indexOf(\"blue\") // returns -1\n##Checking occurrences\n\nNote that '0' doesn't evaluate to true and '-1' doesn't evaluate to false. Therefore, when checking if a specific string exists within another string the correct way to check would be:\n\n\"Blue Whale\".indexOf(\"Blue\") != -1; // true\n\"Blue Whale\".indexOf(\"Bloe\") != -1; // false\n\n#Examples\n##Example: Using indexOf and lastIndexOf\n\nThe following example uses indexOf and lastIndexOf to locate values in the string \"Brave new world\".\n\n\tvar anyString = \"Brave new world\";\n\n\tconsole.log(\"The index of the first w from the beginning is \" + anyString.indexOf(\"w\"));\n\t// Displays 8\n\tconsole.log(\"The index of the first w from the end is \" + anyString.lastIndexOf(\"w\")); \n\t// Displays 10\n\n\tconsole.log(\"The index of 'new' from the beginning is \" + anyString.indexOf(\"new\"));   \n\t// Displays 6\n\tconsole.log(\"The index of 'new' from the end is \" + anyString.lastIndexOf(\"new\"));\n\t// Displays 6\n##Example: indexOf and case-sensitivity\n\nThe following example defines two string variables. The variables contain the same string except that the second string contains uppercase letters. The first log method displays 19. But because the indexOf method is case sensitive, the string \"cheddar\" is not found in myCapString, so the second log method displays -1.\n\n\tvar myString    = \"brie, pepper jack, cheddar\";\n\tvar myCapString = \"Brie, Pepper Jack, Cheddar\";\n\n\tconsole.log('myString.indexOf(\"cheddar\") is ' + myString.indexOf(\"cheddar\"));    \n\t// Displays 19\n\tconsole.log('myCapString.indexOf(\"cheddar\") is ' + myCapString.indexOf(\"cheddar\")); \n\t// Displays -1\n##Example: Using indexOf to count occurrences of a letter in a string\n\nThe following example sets count to the number of occurrences of the letter x in the string str:\n\n\tcount = 0;\n\tpos = str.indexOf(\"x\");\n\n\twhile ( pos != -1 ) {\n\t   count++;\n\t   pos = str.indexOf( \"x\",pos + 1 );\n\t}","children":[{"annotation":"param","type":"{String}","name":"searchValue","text":"A string representing the value to search for.","theRestString":"@param {Number} fromIndex The location within the calling string to start the search from.

(Mimics of the Underscore and jQuery APIs, such as Lo-Dash and Zepto, will also tend to work, with varying degrees of compatibility.)\n\n#Introduction\n\nWhen working on a web application that involves a lot of JavaScript, one of the first things you learn is to stop tying your data to the DOM. It's all too easy to create JavaScript applications that end up as tangled piles of jQuery selectors and callbacks, all trying frantically to keep data in sync between the HTML UI, your JavaScript logic, and the database on your server. For rich client-side applications, a more structured approach is often helpful.\n\nWith Backbone, you represent your data as Models, which can be created, validated, destroyed, and saved to the server.

It's all too easy to create JavaScript applications that end up as tangled piles of jQuery selectors and callbacks, all trying frantically to keep data in sync between the HTML UI, your JavaScript logic, and the database on your server. For rich client-side applications, a more structured approach is often helpful.\n\nWith Backbone, you represent your data as Models, which can be created, validated, destroyed, and saved to the server.

The called function can attach callbacks using deferred.then(), for example.\n\nA Deferred object starts in the pending state. Any callbacks added to the object with deferred.then(), deferred.always(), deferred.done(), or deferred.fail() are queued to be executed later. Calling deferred.resolve() or deferred.resolveWith() transitions the Deferred into the resolved state and immediately executes any doneCallbacks that are set. Calling deferred.reject() or deferred.rejectWith() transitions the Deferred into the rejected state and immediately executes any failCallbacks that are set. Once the object has entered the resolved or rejected state, it stays in that state. Callbacks can still be added to the resolved or rejected Deferred — they will execute immediately.\n\n##Enhanced Callbacks with jQuery Deferred\n\nIn JavaScript it is common to invoke functions that optionally accept callbacks that are called within that function. For example, in versions prior to jQuery 1.5, asynchronous processes such as jQuery.ajax() accept callbacks to be invoked some time in the near-future upon success, error, and completion of the ajax request.\n\njQuery.Deferred() introduces several enhancements to the way callbacks are managed and invoked. In particular, jQuery.Deferred() provides flexible ways to provide multiple callbacks, and these callbacks can be invoked regardless of whether the original callback dispatch has already occurred. jQuery Deferred is based on the CommonJS Promises/A design.\n\nOne model for understanding Deferred is to think of it as a chain-aware function wrapper. The deferred.then(), deferred.always(), deferred.done(), and deferred.fail() methods specify the functions to be called and the deferred.resolve(args) or deferred.reject(args) methods \"call\" the functions with the arguments you supply. Once the Deferred has been resolved or rejected it stays in that state; a second call to deferred.resolve(), for example, is ignored. If more functions are added by deferred.then(), for example, after the Deferred is resolved, they are called immediately with the arguments previously provided.\n\nIn most cases where a jQuery API call returns a Deferred or Promise-compatible object, such as jQuery.ajax() or jQuery.when(), you will only want to use the deferred.then(), deferred.done(), and deferred.fail() methods to add callbacks to the Deferred's queues. The internals of the API call or code that created the Deferred will invoke deferred.resolve() or deferred.reject() on the deferred at some point, causing the appropriate callbacks to run.","children":[{"annotation":"param","type":"{Function}","name":"beforeStart","text":"Optional\nType: Function( Deferred deferred )\nA function that is called just before the constructor returns.\nThe jQuery.Deferred() constructor creates a new Deferred object.

Since deferred.always() returns the Deferred object, other methods of the Deferred object can be chained to this one, including additional .always() methods. When the Deferred is resolved or rejected, callbacks are executed in the order they were added, using the arguments provided to the resolve, reject, resolveWith or rejectWith method calls.
